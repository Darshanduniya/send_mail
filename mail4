Subject: Testing of Spark Pool and Retry Option in ACC_OPM – Cutover & Post-Cutover Plan

Dear [Recipient's Name],

We would like to inform you that we are testing the Spark Pool and Retry Option in ACC_OPM. The cutover for this change is scheduled for today.

Once the cutover is completed, we will proceed with testing. After successful validation, we plan to implement the changes across all other DAGs.

Please let us know if you have any concerns or require further details.
